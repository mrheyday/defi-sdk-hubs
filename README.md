**DeFi SDK** is an open-source system of smart contracts designed for precise DeFi portfolio accounting. To put it simply, DeFi SDK is the on-chain *balanceOf* for DeFi protocols.

If you have any questions about DeFi SDK, feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://go.zerion.io/discord).

## Features

**ðŸ’¥Query user assets and debt deposited in DeFi protocols like *Maker, Aave, dYdX*, etc.**
> How much debt does `0xdead..beef` have on Compound?

**ðŸ“ŠGet the underlying components of complex derivative ERC20 tokens**
> How much `cUSDC` vs `ETH` does `ETHMACOAPY` have?

**âœ¨Interact with multiple DeFi protocols in a unified way**
> See [How to interact with DeFi SDK contracts](docs/interacting.md)

## Addresses

**AdapterRegistry** contract is deployed to the mainnet and its source code is verified on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06fe76b2f432fdfecaef1a7d4f6c3d41b5861672#code).

All the deployed contracts' addresses are available [here](docs/addresses.md).


## How to Add Your Adapter

The full instructions on how to add a custom adapter to the **AdapterRegistry** contract may be found in our [docs](docs/creating-your-adapters/index.md).
